  <P>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name 
    <br>their children after the day of the week
    <br>they were born and the order in which they
    <br>were born. These "day names" have further
    <br>meanings conccerning the soul and character
    <br>of the person. Middle names have considerably
    <br>more variety and can refer to their birth 
    <br>order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</P>
